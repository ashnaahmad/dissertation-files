Files used in my undergraduate thesis, 'A connectionist model of dependency length minimisation.'

Currently contains the input files for the connectionist model and 1000 sentences produced by the model, labelled with their sentence-peripheral dependency types and whether or not the sentence-peripheral dependency is the longest in each sentence.
